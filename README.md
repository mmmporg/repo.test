# Doc of github and git tuto

## init the project

```bash
git init
git remote add origin SSH_REPO
git branch -M main
git push origin main
```

## write a commit

- title of commit

- description of commit with informations and evolution about the project

## Creation of a branch

```bash
git checkout -b NAME_OF_BRANCH
```

for good practices, we are going to integrate the notion of review of code:
- create a branch
- do some modifications
- send it to the repository (online)
- create a pull-request to ask a review of code
## Send a commit to the distant repository

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "title of the commit"
git push origin main
```

## Creation of branch

```bash
git checkout -b _branch_name
```

For good practiced we are going to integrate the concept of code review. To do this, we will need to create a branch, make modifications, push them to the remote repository, and then create a pull request to request a code review.
